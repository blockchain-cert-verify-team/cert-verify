# Frontend (React + Vite)

See the root `README.md` for full setup and environment variables. This app expects the backend at `APP_BASE_URL` and uses `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` in emails/QR to open the verify page.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

App runs on `http://localhost:5173` by default.
