# Implementation Summary: Enhanced Inventory Management System

## ✅ Completed Enhancements

### 1. Expanded Item Struct
- ✅ Added `sku` field for Stock Keeping Unit
- ✅ Added `price` field for item value (USDC with 6 decimals)
- ✅ Added `supplier` field for supplier address
- ✅ Added `category` field using `bytes32` for gas efficiency
- ✅ Added `status` field for item lifecycle management

### 2. Item Lifecycle and Status Management
- ✅ Created `Status` enum with Active, Paused, Discontinued states
- ✅ Implemented `setItemStatus()` function
- ✅ Updated `recordSale()` to check item status before allowing sales
- ✅ Added status validation with custom error handling

### 3. Enhanced Data Retrieval and Discovery
- ✅ Implemented on-chain indexes for item discovery
- ✅ Added `getAllItemIds()` function
- ✅ Added `getItemsBySupplier()` function
- ✅ Added `getItemsByCategory()` function
- ✅ Added `getTotalItems()` function
- ✅ Automatic index updates when adding items

### 4. Supply Chain Integration
- ✅ Created `Supplier` struct with name and approval status
- ✅ Implemented supplier management functions
- ✅ Added `addSupplier()` and `removeSupplier()` functions
- ✅ Added `isSupplierApproved()` validation
- ✅ Integrated supplier validation in item creation

### 5. History and Auditing
- ✅ Created `LogEntry` struct for audit trail
- ✅ Implemented `_itemHistory` mapping for each item
- ✅ Added `getItemHistory()` function
- ✅ Automatic logging for all item changes:
  - Item creation
  - Sales transactions
  - Stock received
  - Status changes
- ✅ Added `_logItemChange()` internal helper function

### 6. Gas Optimization and Error Handling
- ✅ Replaced `require()` statements with custom errors
- ✅ Added comprehensive custom error types:
  - `ItemNotFound`
  - `ItemNotActive`
  - `InsufficientStock`
  - `SupplierNotApproved`
  - `UnauthorizedAction`
- ✅ Updated modifier to use custom errors

### 7. Enhanced Events
- ✅ Updated `ItemAdded` event with all new fields
- ✅ Added `ItemStatusChanged` event
- ✅ Added `SupplierAdded` and `SupplierRemoved` events
- ✅ Added `StockReceived` event
- ✅ Added `SaleRecorded` event

### 8. Comprehensive Testing
- ✅ Created complete Solidity test suite (`InventoryEnhanced.t.sol`)
- ✅ Tests cover all new functionality
- ✅ Tests include error handling scenarios
- ✅ Tests verify gas-efficient operations
